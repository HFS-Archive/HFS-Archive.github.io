The HFS file Archive
===


Welcome to the HFS file Archive. The purpose of this site is for historical reference materials relevant to the High Fantasy Society. There may be some crossover with other LARP games, particularly with Amtgard.

[Documents](#!documents.md) has rulebooks, guides, and tutorials.

[Music](#!music.md) has mp3 files recorded at events by HFS members at bardics (with much of it collected by Sir Terwin).

[Undergund](#!undergund.md) is a publication produced in the early days by members of Barad-Duin.

If anyone wishes to add more to this archive, they may contact Sir Maxim. 

*Removal requests will require verification of copyright or a pretty good reason. Sir Maxim is a pretty cooperative guy in these matters.*
